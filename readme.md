# Simple JS bot
### This is a simple Discord bot that is written with Discord.js. You can use it as a basic template for your own bot.

## Note:
- You might have to add `"type": "module"` into your package.json file in order to use the `node-fetch` module which is used to use the `fetch()` function.
- By changing this, the syntax of importing modules changes as well.
